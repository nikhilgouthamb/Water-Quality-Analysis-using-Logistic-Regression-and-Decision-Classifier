# Water Quality Analysis using Logistic Regression and Decision Classifier

This project aims to analyze water quality data from Kaggle using Python. The goal is to develop and implement Logistic Regression and Decision Classifier models to perform accurate predictions and classifications for various parameters related to water quality. 

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- Implementation of Logistic Regression and Decision Classifier models.
- Optimization of model performance using appropriate techniques.
- Visualization of results and explanations for effective communication.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about various parameters related to water quality.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the code)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `water_quality_analysis.ipynb` to execute the analysis and view the results.

## Results
The models developed in this project provide accurate predictions and classifications for water quality parameters. The EDA and visualizations help in understanding the data and the factors affecting water quality.
